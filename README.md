Add a div to your html document, using bootstraps container class, have this be a container.
To visually see what a container class does to a div, we will need to apply some styling to it in CSS. Letâ€™s go to our CSS document and apply a background-color of blue and a height of 500px to anything with a class named container (Which for now should only be 1 element).
Change the class on the div from a container to a container-fluid. Don't forget to change your CSS selector to container-fluid as well! Refresh and take not of the differences. Once you are finished visually seeing the difference between the two, remove or comment out the styling in the CSS file.
